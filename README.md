# Brute
A simple Brute Force program

## What will Brute work on?
- Brute currently only supports 4 character passwords.
- Brute works by randomly typing 4 letters, pressing enter, and the backspace 4 times
  - With this said Brute will work on any input field that will submit on enter and does not deselect the desired field

## Instructions:
  1. Download or clone Brute
  2. Navigate to text field to brute force
  3. Double click the Brute shortcut and immediately click in the input bar
  4. You will have 3 seconds to click in the input
  5. When done click the 'x' on the command prompt that opens

## Note:
- It may occasionally mess up and have too many letters, just close it and start it again.
  - A patch for this is under development


## In the future Brute will support:
  - An option of how many characters
  - An option for a range of number of characters
  - An option to try every possible combination
  - A GUI to select options
  - Brute force entry on a username and password combination
